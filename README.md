## Overview
This report provides a snapshot of the retail company's sales performance, highlighting key metrics, trends, and geographical distribution.he company processed 24,000 orders, resulting in the sale of 86,000 items. The total revenue generated was $30 million, with $3 million in taxes and a total due amount of $34 million. The freight costs associated with these sales totaled $913,000.

Yearly Trends show a peak in orders in 2013 with 11,400 orders, but there was a significant drop to 5,300 orders in 2014, indicating potential challenges in sustaining sales growth.

Geographically, the majority of sales are concentrated in North America and Europe, with lesser activity in other regions like Asia, Africa, and South America. This suggests strong market presence in key regions but also highlights potential for expansion into underrepresented markets.

Order Status shows that most orders are in the "Approved" stage, with significant amounts due, indicating a healthy sales pipeline. However, there are opportunities to optimize processes related to canceled, rejected, and backordered orders to improve overall performance.

This overview encapsulates the company's current sales landscape, pinpointing areas of strength and opportunities for further growth and optimization.

## Conclusion 

The company has a strong market presence, particularly in North America and Europe, with a substantial volume of sales and orders.
However, the decline in orders from 2013 to 2014 suggests that the company may need to investigate the reasons behind this drop and take corrective actions to regain sales momentum.
The dominance of bike sales suggests that the company should continue to focus on this product category but also explore opportunities to increase sales of other categories like components and clothing.
The concentration of sales in specific regions indicates potential for market expansion in underrepresented areas like Asia and Africa.

## Recommendations
Investigate Decline in Sales:

Analyze the factors that contributed to the drop in orders from 2013 to 2014, such as market conditions, competition, or changes in customer preferences.
Develop strategies to address these issues, such as marketing campaigns or product promotions to attract customers.
Expand Product Focus:

While bikes are the leading product category, consider strategies to boost sales in components and clothing, such as bundling products or offering discounts.
Research customer needs and preferences to identify potential new product categories or enhancements to existing ones.
Geographical Expansion:

Explore opportunities to expand sales in regions with lower market penetration, such as Asia, Africa, and South America.
Consider targeted marketing campaigns or partnerships in these regions to increase brand visibility and sales.
Optimize Order Process:

Monitor and streamline the order processing stages, particularly focusing on reducing the number of canceled, rejected, and backordered orders.
Implement systems to ensure smoother transitions between order statuses, which could improve overall customer satisfaction and reduce total due amounts.
Focus on High-Value Customers:

Identify and target high-value customers who contribute to the larger orders and higher total amounts due, especially in the "Approved" and "In Process" stages.
Implement loyalty programs or personalized offers to retain these customers and encourage repeat business.
These steps should help the company stabilize its sales performance, explore new growth opportunities, and improve overall operational efficiency.
